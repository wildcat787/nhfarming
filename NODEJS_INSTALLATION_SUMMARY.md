## üß™ Weather Integration Test Results

### ‚úÖ What's Working:
- Node.js and npm are properly installed
- Backend dependencies are installed
- Frontend dependencies are installed
- Ecowitt weather module loads successfully
- Database schema is properly set up

### ‚ö†Ô∏è What Needs Configuration:
- Weather station connection is not configured yet
- Environment variables need to be set for your Ecowitt station

## üöÄ Next Steps

### 1. Configure Your Weather Station

You have two options for connecting your Ecowitt weather station:

#### Option A: Local Network Connection (Recommended)
```bash
# Set your weather station's IP address
export ECOWITT_LOCAL_URL="http://YOUR_STATION_IP"
# Example: export ECOWITT_LOCAL_URL="http://192.168.1.100"
```

#### Option B: Cloud API Connection
```bash
# Set your Ecowitt API credentials
export ECOWITT_APP_KEY="your_application_key"
export ECOWITT_USER_API_KEY="your_api_key"
export ECOWITT_DEVICE_MAC="your_device_mac"
```

### 2. Test the Weather Integration

```bash
# Go to backend directory
cd backend

# Test the weather integration
node test-weather-simple.js
```

### 3. Start the Application

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start the backend
cd backend
npm start

# Terminal 2: Start the frontend
cd frontend
npm start
```

### 4. Test in Browser

1. Open http://localhost:3000
2. Log in to your account
3. Go to Applications page
4. Look for the cloud download icon next to the temperature field
5. Click it to fetch current weather from your station

- **`backend/test-weather-manual.md`** - Manual testing guide
- **`backend/test-weather-simple.js`** - Simple test script

## üîß Troubleshooting

### If you get "node: command not found" in a new terminal:
```bash
# Load nvm in the current session
source ~/.nvm/nvm.sh

# Or restart your terminal (nvm will auto-load)
```

### If you need to switch Node.js versions:
```bash
nvm list                    # See installed versions
nvm use 18                  # Switch to Node.js 18
nvm use --lts              # Switch to latest LTS
```

### If you need to install a different Node.js version:
```bash
nvm install 18              # Install Node.js 18
nvm install --lts          # Install latest LTS
```

## üéâ Success!

You now have a fully functional Node.js environment and can:
- Run the NHFarming backend and frontend
- Test the weather integration
- Develop and modify the application
- Install additional npm packages as needed

The weather integration is ready to use once you configure your Ecowitt weather station!
